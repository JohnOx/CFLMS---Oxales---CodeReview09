First Backend Project
# Mail Delivery Services

Project Description:

A mail delivery service company receives packages/mail from customers at a specific location or picks up packages from a specific location. These packages/mail are processed by an employee. These packages/mail are then sent into a processing system where they will later be delivered to a recipient. There will be a time and date when the package/mail was deposited and when it was received.

Did you ever think about the system that makes a delivery system happen? What are the logical connections between data structures? For instance, it is clear that a single package is somehow connected to a customer, as well as the drop-off point - but how does all this fit together in a logical structure? What fields do you need in your tables, and how are they structured?

Now it is time to design a database for such a mail delivery company. The company doesnâ€™t have any special requirements; the specification is opened for interpretation.


For this CodeReview, the following criteria will be graded:

Basic points:

- Use 4 steps for database development process - ensure that your database is in 3rd Normal Form. Ensure that all elements given as bold in the task description (Task description: Mail Delivery Service) are covered in your database design. (hint: use draw.io tool, but try to draw the delivery process first on a paper before creating any diagrams in digital form). Please save your diagram(s) as pdf files in one folder and upload this folder to the project database to GitHub.

- Recreate your database design in MySQL. Name your database as cr09_john_doe_delivery (use your name instead of "john" and "doe"). Export your database as cr09_john_doe_delivery.sql dump file and then upload the .sql file with the project to GitHub.

- Insert test data into the database (insert some dummy data in your database, at least 3 sets of data per table)

- Create at least 6 different SQL queries to show the power of your database (save these queries to  cr09_john_doe_delivery_queries.sql file and upload it to the project) Note: The use of JOINS is required for at least two queries). These queries should show similar results to:  how many packages/mail were sent from this specific city, who sent packages/mail on this date, who sent packages/mail between this and that date, etc. 


Bonus points:

- Expand initial specification with more than 10 tables

- Use JOINS in your SQL queries that connect more than 3 tables.
